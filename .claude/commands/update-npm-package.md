Let us update the NPM package to incorporate the latest edits.

Procedure:

1: Iterate package number in package.json.

2: Validate test build.

IF validation is good:

3: Push to registry and push Github.

Note: you'll need an OTP which I will provide. So as soon as you're ready to run npm publish ask me for it.

In commit notes: if you know the update, draft it. If not, I can provide a summary. 

Generally: releases will be point releases fixing or tweaking individual tools. Only substantial changes will merit a major version.

Finally:

4: Run update script to update my own copy of the server from the registry.
